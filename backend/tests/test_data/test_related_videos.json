            "description": "Sadhguru | PRETTY INTENSE PODCAST | Ep. 106\n\nOn the Pretty Intense podcast today is Sadhguru who is a pretty intensely spiritual man. Sadhguru is a renowned speaker,  a best-selling author, and founder of the Isha Foundation, whose mission is to raise human consciousness through individual transformation, focusing on human empowerment and social revitalization. For any of you out there doing some spiritual diving, you no doubt have come across Sadhguru. This was a true honor to speak to him. His wisdom is wide and deep, and he‚Äôs also very playful and fun. He has a real true understanding of the human experience, and how to essentially escape karma. This is what we talked about most. How memory affects us, and ways to make peace with it.
